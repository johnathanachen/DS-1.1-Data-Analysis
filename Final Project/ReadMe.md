# Final Project
clean, investigate, and analyze a dataset

Where your data came from
http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html (Austin)

What questions you were looking to answer
- How is Airbnb really being used in and affecting your neighborhoods?
- Can a vibe be described with each Austin neighborhood using listing descriptions?
- What are the busiest times of the year to visit Austin? By how much do prices spike?
- Is there a general upward trend of both new Airbnb listings and total Airbnb visitors to Austin?
- How does the income from Airbnb compare to a long-term lease?
- Compare the price of renting to a tourist full-time rather than a resident. (one fixed cost for resident compared to dynamic pricing based on season and supply for tourist with stays a week and longer)
